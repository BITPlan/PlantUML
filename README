Hi, welcome to the PlantUML plugin for MediaWiki.
The full project page for this plugin can be found on 

   http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PlantUML

In order to install this plugin, please follow the steps below.

1. Go to the extensions folder of your MediaWiki installation. On RedHat and
   derivates this will be /usr/share/mediawiki/extensions.
   $ cd /usr/share/mediawiki/extensions

2. Create a new subdirectory PlanetUML in this folder and move to this
   directory.
   $ mkdir PlantUML && cd PlantUML

3. Get the plantuml.jar from SourceForge
   wget https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/plantuml/plantuml.jar
   
4. Move this file into the PlantUML directory as PlantUML.php
   $ mv <downloaddir>/PlantUML.php .

5. (Optional) Edit PlantUML.php and change the variable $planetImagetype
   to your preference. Mind that SVG produces the superior graphics, but that
   only PNG-images and image maps are "rock solid".

6. Adapt the getUploadPath and getUploadDirectory to your preference
   if you want these different from MediaWiki's standard settings.
   Mind that these directories must be writeable by the system user
   who runs MediaWiki.

7. Put the following line near the end of your LocalSettings.php in
   MediaWiki's root folder to include the extension:

require_once('extensions/PlantUML/PlantUML.php');

8. Reload http
   $ service httpd graceful

9. Enjoy!
