Hi, welcome to the PlantUML plugin for MediaWiki.
The full project page for this plugin can be found on 

   http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PlantUML

In order to install this plugin, please follow the steps below.

1. Choose your usage style. You can either process images locally (on the
   server where MediaWiki was installed) or in the cloud. The local version
   supports SVG-images and embedded links, at the cost of local processing.
   If you want this, use the file PlantUML.php

   The cloud version is lightweight for your server, but does not support
   embedded links (yet) and is (still) stuck with PNG-images. If you can
   live with this then choose PlantUML-cloud.php
   
2. Go to the extensions folder of your MediaWiki installation. On RedHat and
   derivates this will be /usr/share/mediawiki/extensions.
   # cd /usr/share/mediawiki/extensions

3. Create a new subdirectory PlantUML in this folder and move to this
   directory.
   # mkdir PlantUML && cd PlantUML

4. Get the plantuml.jar from SourceForge (not with the cloud version)
   # wget https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/plantuml/plantuml.jar
   
5. Move the choosen php-file into the PlantUML directory
   # mv <downloaddir>/PlantUML.php .
   (or)
   # mv <downloaddir>/PlantUML-cloud.php .

6. (Optional, local version only) Edit the PHP-file and change the variable
   $plantumlImagetype to your preference. Mind that SVG produces the superior
   graphics, but that only PNG-images and image maps are "rock solid".

7. Adapt the getUploadPath and getUploadDirectory to your preference if you
   want these different from MediaWiki's standard settings. Mind that these
   directories must be writeable by the system user who runs MediaWiki.

8. Put the following line near the end of your LocalSettings.php in
   MediaWiki's root folder to include the extension:

require_once('extensions/PlantUML/PlantUML.php');
(or)
require_once('extensions/PlantUML/PlantUML-cloud.php');

9. (cloud version only) Check your httpd settings. httpd must be able to send
   HTTP-requests.

10. Reload http
   $ service httpd graceful

11. Enjoy!
